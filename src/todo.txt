v0.5.0

OPTIMIZATION:

currently, the entire building is getting re-generated from scratch any time anything in it changes.
obviously this is wasteful, but:
- this library isn't particularly likely to be used in a context where these properties will be changing at runtime (at least outside of debugging)
- right now I am more concerned with getting it out the door than making it perfect anyway

PLANNED FEATURES TO COME (in order):
- greater control over UV generation
- automatic collision assignment
- doors lifted above the ground (i.e. windows)
- accept a shape to be extruded around a doorhole to make a doorframe (& around a floor to make a baseboard)

KNOWN ISSUES (with no obvious solution that would preserve ease of use):
- floor/ceiling triangulation is not controllable (and therefore varying wall verticality is nearly useless unless slope is consistent)
- doorhole parenting is always level to the horizon even on slope-floored walls
- the setTimeout thing results in a one-frame flash of invisible walls: is it worth it? (is there a smarter thing to listen for, maybe?)

ISSUES THAT COULD THEORETICALLY BE FIXED BUT DON'T SEEM WORTH THE TROUBLE:
- walls are internally rearranged to always wind CW, which means wall parenting will point towards the "previous" wall if you entered them in CCW order
